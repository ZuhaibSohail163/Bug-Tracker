# Bug-Tracker
Tasks:

Everyone should execute user stories they have written and update the status of execution of them accordingly.

Automation Tool:

As our project is mainly in javascript, we have selected cucumber and nightwatch as our automation tool. Everyone is to watch basic tutorials about these tools and learn how to code the automation of our project using these tools.

Agenda for next meeting:

In the next meeting we will be discussing about the progress of familiarity with these tools and what to do afterwards.
